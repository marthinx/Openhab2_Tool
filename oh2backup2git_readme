reliable nowadays.

Ok, so here is my quick write-up:

***I’m running this on a Raspberry Pi 3 running openHAB 2.1 stable installed via the repository installation path.

My directory layout (These locations will be created in the instructions below):
/data/scripts/openhab2backup - backup script
/data/logs/ - backupscript log location
/data/openhab2backup/ - local temporary backup location

***Take note of the ()‘s below i.e. (YOUR BITBUCKET ACCOUNT NAME)…

Create a Bitbucket account and a private repository called “openhab2backup”.

Create key on raspberry pi:

mkdir -p /root/.ssh
chmod 0700 /root/.ssh
ssh-keygen -t rsa -C „(YOUR E-MAIL ADDRESS)“
Copy the contents of /root/.ssh/id_rsa.pub (starts with “ssh-rsa”) into the ssh key section for main user (your main account) of Bitbucket (not a deploy key as that’s read only).

Test connection now from raspberry pi:

ssh -T (YOUR BITBUCKET ACCOUNT NAME)@bitbucket.org
Should see:

root@rpi01:~/.ssh# ssh -T (YOUR BITBUCKET ACCOUNT NAME)@bitbucket.org
logged in as (YOUR BITBUCKET ACCOUNT NAME).
You can use git or hg to connect to Bitbucket. Shell access is disabled.
root@rpi01:~/.ssh#
Set default git config:

#I just made up the user.name and user.email. It’s not really important.
git config —global user.name „openhab2backup“
git config —global user.email „openhab2backup@auto.com“
git config —global push.default simple
Create Backup Location:

cd /data
git clone git@bitbucket.org:(YOUR BITBUCKET ACCOUNT NAME)/openhab2backup.git
 
#This will create the git directory - /data/openhab2backup
Make temp local backup and perform first directory sync manually:

mkdir -p /data/openhab2backup/configuration
mkdir -p /data/openhab2backup/userdata
mkdir -p /data/openhab2backup/runtime
rsync -r /etc/openhab2 /data/openhab2backup/configuration
rsync -r /var/lib/openhab2 /data/openhab2backup/userdata
rsync -r /usr/share/openhab2 /data/openhab2backup/runtime
Add untracked directories:

#this will show tracked and untracked files:
git status 
cd /data/openhab2backup
git add configuration 
git add userdata
git add runtime
Git Commit:

git commit -m “First Push”
Git Push (Can take a while the first time):

git push
Check Bitbucket now to see if code was pushed up.

Create file named “openhab2backup” and paste the contents below. Place in /data/scripts/

 Create Cron:

crontab -e
Paste the following at the bottom and save.

00 00 * * * /data/scripts/openhab2backup
